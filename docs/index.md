**JSON Web Token**

A minimal JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation using the **HS256** algorithm for signing and verification, conforming to the JWS (JSON Web Signature) standard. Designed for secure, lightweight authentication in systems where symmetric key signing is sufficient.

If you need more functionality or code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Jwt Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-blitz/jwt) and buy us some coffee.
