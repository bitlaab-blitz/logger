**Asynchronous Logging with Cross-Platform Blocking Fallback**

A lightweight and efficient logger that provides non-blocking, asynchronous logging on Linux using [Saturn](https://bitlaabsaturn.web.app/) while maintaining blocking, cross-platform compatibility for Windows and macOS. Designed to minimize I/O latency and reduce performance overhead, it offers flexible log levels, optional terminal output, and thread-safe operations, making it ideal for both high-performance servers and portable applications.

If you need more functionality or code coverage, Please create an issue at [**Logger Repo**](https://github.com/bitlaab-blitz/logger) and buy us some coffee.
